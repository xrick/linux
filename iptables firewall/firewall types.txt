A firewall is a filter that restricts access to and/or from computers or services.
Broadly speaking, two types of firewalls exist: packet-filter firewalls, which work by blocking
or permitting access based on low-level information in individual data packets (such as
source and destination IP addresses and ports), and proxy filters, which partially process
a transaction (such as a web page retrieval) and block or permit access based on high-level
features in this transaction (such as the filename of an image in the web page).

In Linux, the kernel includes packet-filter firewall capabilities, which can be programmed
via the iptables program. You can set up rules by typing iptables followed by various
options that define specific restrictions, such as limits on the IP addresses that may
access a specific network port. Creating an effective firewall requires learning iptables
in detail and writing a script that calls this program repeatedly to set up specific rules.
The nftables program is slated to replace the iptables program. See netfilter.org/
projects/nftables for the current status of this program.

Many distributions make things easier by providing a generic firewall script that you
can configure using a GUI tool or text-based command. For example, Ubuntu offers the
Uncomplicated Firewall utility, ufx, to help set up iptables rules. These tools are generally
designed for protecting a single computer against unwanted outside access. Check your
distributionâ€™s GUI system administration options and man pages for a firewall configuration
tool. You may be able to set security based on a few levels (high, medium, and low security,
for instance) or in a somewhat more refined manner.

Linux can also function as a firewall computer that protects an entire network; however,
such a configuration is likely to require in-depth knowledge of iptables, as well as
topics which include configuring Linux as a router.

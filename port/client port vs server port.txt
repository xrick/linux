When they start up, servers tie themselves to specific ports, which by convention are
associated with specific server programs. For instance, port 25 is associated with email
servers, and port 80 is used by web servers

A client can direct its request to a specific port and expect to contact
an appropriate server. The client’s own port number isn’t fixed; it’s assigned by the OS.
Because the client initiates a transfer, it can include its own port number in the connection
request, so clients don’t need fixed port numbers. Assigning client port numbers dynamically also enables one computer to run several instances of a single client easily because they won’t compete for access to a single port.

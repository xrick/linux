In this modification, the user can enter either a username to be created or Exit to leave
the script. The case statement checks for Exit, and if it’s found, the commands in the Exit
section are executed. Anything else entered is assumed to be a username, and the script
continues.
Upon execution, bash executes the commands associated with the first pattern to match
the variable’s contents. Execution then jumps to the line following the esac statement; any
intervening commands don’t execute. If no patterns match the word, no code within the
case statement executes.

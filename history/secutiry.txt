Because your bash history is stored in a file, it can be examined by
anybody who can read that file. Some commands enable you to type
passwords or other sensitive data on the same line as the commands
themselves, which can therefore be risky. The ~/.bash_history file does
not record what you type in response to other programsâ€™ prompts, just
what you type at the bash prompt itself. Thus, if you have a choice, you
should let commands that require passwords (or other sensitive data)
prompt you to enter this data rather than enter such information as
options to the command at the bash prompt.

Retrieve a Command The simplest way to do this is to press the Up arrow key on your
keyboard; this brings up the previous command. Pressing the Up arrow key repeatedly
moves through multiple commands so you can find the one you want. If you overshoot,
press the Down arrow key to move down the history. The Ctrl+P and Ctrl+N keystrokes
double for the Up and Down arrow keys, respectively.

Search for a Command Press Ctrl+R to begin a backward (reverse) search, and begin
typing characters that should be unique to the command you want to find. The characters
you type need not be the ones that begin the command; they can exist anywhere in the
command. You can either keep typing until you find the correct command or, after you've
typed a few characters, press Ctrl+R repeatedly until you find the one you want.

The Ctrl+S keystroke is used to search forward in the command history. You can press
the Ctrl+S keystroke while using the backward search. This reverses the history search from
backward to forward. If you used a backward search and have passed by what you need,
then this keystroke is useful.


If the Ctrl+S keystroke causes your terminal to hang, press Ctrl+Q to resume
terminal operations. To keep your terminal from hanging when Ctrl+S is
used, type stty -ixon at the command line.

In either event, if you can't find the command you want or if you change your mind and
want to terminate the search, press Ctrl+G to do so.

In normal operation, a traditional System V init process runs in one of 4 possible multiuser runlevels, 2 through 5. Different systems use runlevels differently, but the highest one used is usually for graphical operation with the X Windows system. The file /etc/inittab controls which processes are started at each runlevel. Systems using upstart have a concept of jobs, while systems with systemd use units to define what things are started and each maps appropriate jobs or units to the traditional System V runlevels. This allows many commands such as telinit to have meaning with the new startup processes. Many of the systemd units are stored in /usr/lib/systemd/system/. Listing 4 shows the mapping from runlevel-equivalent targets to the corresponding systemd targets.

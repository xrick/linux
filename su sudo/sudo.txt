Why doesn't `sudo cd /var/named` work?

The reason you can't do this is simple and two fold

cd is not a program but an in-built command and sudo only applies to programs.

sudo foo means run the program foo as root

sudo cd /path returns

sudo: cd: command not found

because cd is not a program.

You can use sudo -s to open an interactive shell and then cd to to your desired directory:

sudo -s
cd /var/named

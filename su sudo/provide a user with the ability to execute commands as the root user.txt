root ALL=(ALL) ALL

This line means: The root user can execute from ALL terminals, acting as ALL (any) users, and run ALL (any) command.

The first part is the user, the second is the terminal from where the user can use sudo command, the third part is which users he may act as, and the last one, is which commands he may run when using sudo.


Precondition: user minhql does not have access to /usr/sbin/useradd command
Step 1: Change to root account
Step 2: visudo (Using visudo, you can allow users to use commands by adding sudo before that command). Then add following command:
minhql	ALL=(ALL)	/usr/sbin/useradd
Save using Esc :wq
Step 3: Change to minhql account
Step 4: Use sudo useradd (The password in this case is minhql's password not root's password). Before adding minhql	ALL=(ALL)	/usr/sbin/useradd , user minhql can't use sudo useradd but after adding, user minhql can use sudo useradd command



If user minhql tries to use sudo command before adding minhql	ALL=(ALL)	/usr/sbin/useradd . Below error will be displayed.
[minhql@localhost ~]$ sudo useradd test

    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

A partition is a logical part of the disk (think of a cake as the entire disk, a slice of that cake would be a partition)

A filesystem is a method of storing / finding files on a hard disk (its on top of the cake so would be icing)
File systems are a way of storing data inside the partitions in a fashion that is easy to manage and read and write data to it. Some do it better than others.

First create partition then create filesystem

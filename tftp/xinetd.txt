server_args	= -c -s /tftpboot


Edit the file /etc/xinetd.d/tftp to look like the following:

service tftp
{
	socket_type	= dgram
	protocol	= udp
	wait		= yes
	user		= root
	server		= /usr/sbin/in.tftpd
	server_args	= -c -s /tftpboot
	disable		= no
	per_source	= 11
	cps		= 100 2
}
			

The changes from the default file are the parameter disable = no (to enable the service) and the server argument -c. This argument allows for the creation of files, which is necessary if you want to save boot or disk images. You may want to make TFTP read only in normal operation.

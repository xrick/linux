tty - Tele TYpewriter.

    A tty is a native terminal device, the backend is either hardware or kernel emulated.
    broad term: can include physical terminals, virtual terminals (e.g. the text-mode terminals in various unices)

    also regularly refers to 'the terminal that this process is wrapped in' (which is what the tty command reports - see its man page)


pty - pseudoterminal (also : ptmx)

    A pty (pseudo terminal device) is a terminal device which is emulated by an other program (example: xterm, screen, or ssh are such programs). 

    which is a pair of a ptmx (pseudoterminal master) and pts (pseudoterminal slave)
    most recognizably used in cases like remote logins (e.g. sshd) and graphical terminals
    In practice, pseudo-terminals are used for implementing terminal emulators such as xterm
           Pseudo-terminals  can  also be used to send input to programs that normally refuse to read input from pipes (such as su and passwd)
		   
		   
For example: Login to CentOS in cmd line mode, then use tty command
/dev/tty1

Login to CentOS using graphics mode, then use tty command
[root@localhost ~]# tty
/dev/pts/1


ssh to CentOS from a client, then use tty command
[root@localhost ~]# tty
/dev/pts/0

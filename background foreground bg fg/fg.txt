 If you have started the process without using "screen" command then you cannot take over that process. Basically you cannot take over a process that was started in a different shell.

When your session is terminated all the bg process will go the detached state. Though you might be able to see the details of such process you cannot fg them to a shell from login afterwards
 
 type fg to bring the last process back to foreground.

If you have more than one process running in the background, do this:

$ jobs
[1]   Stopped                 vim
[2]-  Stopped                 bash
[3]+  Stopped                 vim 23







3. When you run the jobs command, you see the following output:

          linux-8z04:~ # jobs
[1]-  Stopped                 top
[2]+  Stopped                 vim
[3]   Running                 strace top &

If you were to run the fg command at this time, what would happen?
=> The vim command would be brought to the foreground

 The fg command acts on the last used or last suspended, notated by the + sign . The other jobs must be interacted with by their job id.

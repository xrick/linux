1. Using ampersand
sleep 60 &

2. Using bg
sleep 60
[CTRL-Z]    # Stop process sleep 60
bg          # Run process sleep 60 in background



1 and 2 are equal







[root@localhost ~]# sleep 60
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 sleep 60

after using bg command, sleep command changes state from T to S







1. Executing a background job

Appending an ampersand ( & ) to the command runs the job in the background.

For example, when you execute a find command that might take a lot time to execute, you can put it in the background as shown below. Following example finds all the files under root file system that changed within the last 24 hours.

# find / -ctime -1 > /tmp/changed-file-list.txt &

2. Sending the current foreground job to the background using CTRL-Z and bg command

You can send an already running foreground job to background as explained below:

    Press eCTRL+Zf which will suspend the current foreground job.
    Execute bg to make that command to execute in background.

For example, if youfve forgot to execute a job in a background, you donft need to kill the current job and start a new background job. Instead, suspend the current job and put it in the background as shown below.

# find / -ctime -1 > /tmp/changed-file-list.txt

# [CTRL-Z]
[2]+  Stopped                 find / -ctime -1 > /tmp/changed-file-list.txt

# bg

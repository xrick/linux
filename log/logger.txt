Specify a Message If you don’t specify a file using -f file, logger will log whatever you
type after other options as the message to be logged. If you don’t provide a message on the
command line, logger accepts the input you type on subsequent lines as information to be
logged. You should terminate such input by pressing Ctrl+D.
As an example, suppose you want to log the message “shutting down for system maintenance” to the system log. You can do so by typing the following command:
$ logger shutting down for system maintenance
The result will be an entry like the following, probably in /var/log/messages:
Jul 29 14:09:50 localhost root: shutting down for system maintenance
Adding parameters changes the details of what’s logged as just described. You can place
a call to logger in a script as a way of documenting the script’s activities. For instance, a
system backup script might use logger to record details such as its start and stop times and
the number and size of the files that it has backed up.




 The logger utility can be used to create a one-time log file entry that you specify.
In its simplest form, it takes no special arguments, just a message to be inserted in the
log file

You want to create a log file entry noting that you’re manually shutting down the system
to add a new network card. How might you create this log entry, just prior to using
shutdown?

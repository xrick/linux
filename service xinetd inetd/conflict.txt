In case service ftp is already started (service vsftpd start), you create an ftp file inside /etc/xinetd.d/ then restart xinetd service.
xinetd will try to start a ftp service 
Jun 11 01:39:13 raspberrypi xinetd[21201]: bind failed (Address already in use (errno = 98)). service = ftp
Jun 11 01:39:13 raspberrypi xinetd[21201]: Service ftp failed to start and is deactivated.

=> Can't start. You must stop ftp service first
service vsftpd stop
After that, restart xinetd service.


If you start ftp by using service vsftpd start => ftp works in stand alone mode
If you start ftp by using xinetd server => xinetd is the one responsible to start ftp.

server  = /usr/sbin/vsftpd : Link to the installed server. For example: after install vsftpd server (apt-get install vsftpd). You can use command which vsftpd to find the link to the installed server.


Stream: a reliable two-way connection 
Dgram: a less reliable connection with less overhead
Raw: a low-level connection to the network 

For dgram socket type, we should specify option wait (processed all of its packets and then timed out) since dgram is a less reliable connection
For other socket types, we should specify option nowait (the server connected to its client and freed the socket)


User:	This was the username used to run the server. The root and nobody users were common choices, but others were possible as well. As a general rule, servers were run with a low-privilege user whenever possible as a security precaution. Some servers required root access though.

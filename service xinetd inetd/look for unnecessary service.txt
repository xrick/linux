For spotting unnecessary servers, you can use netstat with its -a and -p options. The
-a option shows all network sockets. The -p option shows the PID and program name that
owns a shown socket.
The output displayed by netstat is so wide that it has to be split into two separate
snipped displays for the book, as shown here. This first netstat output display shows the
three left-hand columns of information:
netstat -ap

[root@localhost xinetd.d]# netstat -ap | less
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 localhost.locald:domain 0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      2695/dnsmasq
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:ssh             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1453/sshd

The netstat command with the -ap options shows active network sockets that can
reveal the presence of servers that are running on your computer

Entries that are not actively connected will show the local address and the foreign address
as asterisks (*)

The State column specifies that the server is listening (LISTEN) for a connection or that
a connection is currently active (ESTABLISHED). There are several additional states as well,
besides the two shown in the preceding example. Type man netstat to learn about more
potential State statuses.

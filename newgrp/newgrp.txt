A user can access files belonging to other groups as long as the user belongs to that
group and the group access permissions allow such access. To run programs or create files
with a group other than the primary group, the user must run the newgrp command to
switch current group membership. For instance, to change to the project2 group as your
current group, you might type the following:
$ newgrp project2
If the user typing this command is listed as a project2 group member in the /etc/group
file, the user’s current group membership changes. Thereafter, files created by that user will
be associated with the project2 group. Alternatively, users can change the group associated
with an existing file by using the chgrp or chown command, as described in Chapter 4,
“Managing Files.”

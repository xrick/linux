Issues About Path
Scripts that work fine when run at the command line but donft work when run from cron are a common problem. The environment is different because cron doesnft run your .bash_profile and .bashrc scripts. Therefore, you can expect a minimal environment, including a basic PATH.
See it for yourself by adding a cron entry such as:
* * * * * env > /tmp/env

That job runs every minute and dumps the environment to /tmp/env:
SHELL=/bin/sh
USER=sean
PATH=/usr/bin:/bin
PWD=/home/sean
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
SHLVL=1
HOME=/home/sean
LOGNAME=sean
_=/usr/bin/env


The environment for a cron job is fairly sparse: The path only has /usr/bin and /bin. It is also missing any additions that you are used to at your own shell, such as in .bash_profile.
While the scripts run out of cron are free to set their own variables internally, cron lets you set environment variables in the usual format:

PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin:/home/sean/bin
0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/backup.sh

The backup script then is run with the extended path set on the first line.
You aren't limited to just setting the path. Any variable will work. Some variable names are special:

 MAILTO : Anything that a job prints to the screen is mailed to this address.
 SHELL : Run the job with a different shell. /bin/bash is used by default.
 CRON_TZ : Use an alternate time zone for the crontab; otherwise, use system time.

You want to run a task on the hour, every other hour starting at 1:00 a.m., with no other restrictions. Which crontab accomplishes this?

0 1-23/2 * * *

Above answer is correct because it uses the 1-23 range of hours and skips 2 every time. 










15 */2 * * * /usr/local/bin/cleanup
The */2 specification for the hour causes the job to execute every
other hour

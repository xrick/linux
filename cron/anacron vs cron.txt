Does your job need to run more than once a day or at a specific time? If so, you need to use crontab.
Is the timing of the job flexible and youÅfre more interested in making sure it's always run, even if it's late? If so, you should use anacron. Is this job on a system that is not always on? As long as the timing constraints work for you, anacron is a good choice.

Which of the following tasks are most likely to be handled by a cron job? (Select two.)
A. Starting an important server when the computer boots
B. Finding and deleting old temporary files
C. Scripting supervised account creation
D. Monitoring disk partition space status and emailing a report
E. Sending files to a printer in an orderly manner

B, D. The cron utility is a good tool for performing tasks that can be done in an
unsupervised manner, such as deleting old temporary files (option B) or checking
to see that disk space is not low (option D). Tasks that require interaction or do not
occur on a scheduled basis, such as creating accounts (option C), aren’t good candidates
for cron jobs, which must execute unsupervised and on a schedule. Although a
cron job could restart a crashed server, it’s not normally used to start a server when
the system boots (option A); that’s done through system startup scripts or a super
server. Sending files to a printer (option E) is generally handled by a print server such
as the cupsd daemon

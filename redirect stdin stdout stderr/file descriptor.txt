echo 'Hello' 1> abc
1 is a file descriptor




A nice feature of redirecting STDOUT is that you do not have to use its file descriptor,
only the operator. Hereâ€™s an example of leaving out the 1 (one) file descriptor, when redirecting STDOUT:
$ echo $PATH > another_path.txt
$
$ cat another_path.txt
/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:
/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/home/Christine/bin
$
You can see that even without the STDOUT file descriptor, the output was redirected to
a file. However, the redirection operator (>) was still needed.

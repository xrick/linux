Which of the following shell redirections will write standard output and standard error output to a file named filename:
>filename 2>&1






Grabbing both streams and putting them into different files is as simple as adding a redirection symbol preceded with the stderr numeral:

find / -iname *.txt > gooddata 2> baddata

This grabs both streams and puts them into their proper files, with nothing displayed to the console.

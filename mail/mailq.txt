mailq is actually a command from sendmail, but due to the compatibility layer most distributions put in place, it runs the appropriate command depending on your MTA of choice. 

For example, When typing mailq, If your current MTA is Postfix then postqueue -p is executed. When typing mailq, if your current MTA is exim then exim -bp is executed. When typing mailq, if your current MTA is qmail then qmail-qread is executed.

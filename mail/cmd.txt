Be aware that many Linux email servers include a program called sendmail. This program is not the sendmail program discussed earlier, but instead an interface to other
email servers. This is done for compatibility reasons, because the original sendmail program was in many distributions. 




mailq is actually a command from sendmail, but due to the compatibility layer most distributions put in place, it runs the appropriate command depending on your MTA of choice. 
For example, When typing mailq, If your current MTA is Postfix then postqueue -p is executed. When typing mailq, if your current MTA is exim then exim -bp is executed. When typing mailq, if your current MTA is qmail then qmail-qread is executed.
An MTA receives a message and stores it in a queue for later processing. A queue allows the MTA to process an email later if the destination MTA isn't listening, or sends an error indicating your MTA should retry the connection later.
This command looks at the mail queue files in /var/spool/mqueue and displays them on the screen. You can see from Example 17-8 that there are two messages in the queue. It is normal to see mail there as typos and spam cause delivery to all sorts of incorrectly configured servers.
If you are looking into problems with delivery to a particular destination, the mail queue is a good place to look, as youâ€™ll see the emails waiting to go out there. The logs, usually /var/log/maillog, are also a good place to look for a historical accounting of each email.


mail -s "Error" -c abort < /tmp/msg root
An email with the subject of Error and the contents from /tmp/msg is sent to the local
users root and cc to abort.
The -s option to mail sets the message subject line, and -c sets carbon copy (cc:)
recipients. Input redirection (via <) reads the contents of a line into mail as a message.
A mail command line normally terminates with the primary recipient.

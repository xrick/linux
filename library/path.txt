Method 1:

To define this variable, simply use (on the shell prompt):

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/sdk/lib"

To make it permanent, you can add above line to /root/.bash_profile or sth like that




Method 2:

Another way to make it permanent is that you can edit the ldconfig files. First, create a new file such as:

sudo vi /etc/ld.so.conf.d/your_lib.conf

Second, add the path in the created file

/path/to/sdk/lib

Finally, run ldconfig to update the cache.

sudo ldconfig

After adding lib(s), using ldconfig -p to check if the lib is added correctly to cache

But these two methods above won't work for java. You need to use alternatives command

=====================================================================================LD_LIBRARY_PATH has higher priority than ld.so.cache=======================================================


Loading specific libraries

If you're running an older application that needs a specific older version of a shared library, or if you're developing a new shared library or version of a shared library, you might want to override the default search paths used by the loader. This might also be needed by scripts that use product-specific shared libraries that might be installed in the /opt tree.

Just as you can set the PATH variable to specify a search path for executables, you can set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to a colon-separated list of directories that should be searched for shared libraries before the system ones specified in ld.so.cache. For example, you might use a command like:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oldstuff:/opt/IBM/AgentController/lib






Method 1:

To define this variable, simply use (on the shell prompt):

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/sdk/lib"

To make it permanent, you can add above line to /root/.bash_profile or sth like that




Method 2:

Another way to make it permanent is that you can edit the ldconfig files. First, create a new file such as:

sudo vi /etc/ld.so.conf.d/your_lib.conf

Second, add the path in the created file

/path/to/sdk/lib

Finally, run ldconfig to update the cache.

sudo ldconfig

After adding lib(s), using ldconfig -p to check if the lib is added correctly to cache


The error is displayed when running eclipse is not asking for a specific library, that's why you above methods won't work.
But these two methods above won't work for java. You need to use alternatives command

alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/jdk1.8.0_91/bin/java 2
alternatives --config java


There are 3 programs which provide 'java'.

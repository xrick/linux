An application that needs to use a shared library asks a service which is called ld.so, otherwise known as the dynamic linker. The dynamic linker knows where all the shared libraries are stored and loads the library for the application

Libraries are typically stored in /lib or /usr/lib for 32-bit libraries and /lib64 or /usr/lib64 for 64 bit binaries. A 64 bit system can load 32 bit applications, so you will likely see both.

Distributions are free to store application-specific shared libraries anywhere, so you may find /lib is just a link /usr/lib and that particular applications may store its libraries in a separate directory.



[root@localhost ~]# ldd /usr/bin/zip
        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffcb5fd5000)
        libbz2.so.1 => /lib64/libbz2.so.1 (0x00007ff5a71dc000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007ff5a6e1b000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007ff5a7400000)
		
		
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 is dynamic linker		
The dynamic linker is called ld.so and is configured in /etc/ld.so.conf

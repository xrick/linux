libld-linux.so.2 bad ELF interpreter

You're on a 64-bit system, and don't have 32-bit library support installed.
To install (baseline) support for 32-bit executables



RHEL, CentOS:

   sudo yum install glibc.i686



Debian or Ubuntu:

   sudo apt-get install ia32-libs

should grab you the (first, main) library you need.










In general, when you get an error like this, just do

yum provides ld-linux.so.2

then you'll see something like:

glibc-2.20-5.fc21.i686 : The GNU libc libraries
Repo        : fedora
Matched from:
Provides    : ld-linux.so.2

and then you just run the following like BRPocock wrote (in case you were wondering what the logic was...):

yum install glibc.i686

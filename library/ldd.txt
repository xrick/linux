ldd: list dynamic dependencies

When you find a program and want to know whethere the libraries it replies on are present, either run it and see what breaks (the unsafe way) or query the program for the necessary libraries with the ldd command:
ldd /usr/bin/passwd
        ...
      libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fa7a3bae000)
      libcrypt.so.1 => /lib64/libcrypt.so.1 (0x00007fa7a3773000)
      /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fa7a55be000)

The output tells you that the passwd command needs access to libc (the C library, which is a basic set of functionality for all applications), the libcrypt, and a peculiarly named shared library that’s actually the dynamic linker itself.

When you find a program and want to know whether the libraries it replies on are present, either run it and see what breaks (the unsafe way) or query the program for the necessary libraries with the ldd command.


[root@localhost ~]# ldd /usr/bin/zip
        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffcb5fd5000)
        libbz2.so.1 => /lib64/libbz2.so.1 (0x00007ff5a71dc000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007ff5a6e1b000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007ff5a7400000)

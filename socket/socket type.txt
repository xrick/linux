Stream: a reliable two-way connection 
Dgram: a less reliable connection with less overhead
Raw: a low-level connection to the network 

For dgram socket type, we should specify option wait (processed all of its packets and then timed out) since dgram is a less reliable connection
For other socket types, we should specify option nowait (the server connected to its client and freed the socket)

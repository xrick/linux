The  -l long listing style is the only way to use the ls command and see the permissions, ownership, and link counts for objects. The only other command that can give such information is the stat command, which shows a single filesystem object at a time.

ls -d foo   Lists just the directory called foo, not the contents.
ls -a       Lists all files, including hidden . files.
ls -i       Lists the inode number for the targetfile or directory. Inodes are the way Linux represents a file on disk 
ls -l      Shows permissions; links; and date, group, and owner information. Permissions dictate who can access the file 
ls -lh     Shows human-readable output of file sizes, in KB, MB, and GB, along with file details

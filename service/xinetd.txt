These files contain a number of settings:
 service—This keyword must be followed by the service name, such as telnet.
 disable—Values include yes (which disables the service and no connections are accepted) and no (which doesn’t disable or enables the service for connections).
 flags—Many and varied flags exist; the most common is REUSE, which allows the port and service to accept multiple connections.
 socket type—This can be stream, dgram, raw, rdm, or seqpacket.
 wait—Use the wait parameter for single-threaded servers that grab the socket and operate until timeout; use nowait for multithreaded servers that free up the socket when not active.
 user—The user or group this service should run as, giving you the ability to restrict a risky service to an account that’s not root.

The /etc/security/limits.conf file defines various limits on user resources, including the number of simultaneous login individual users are permitted

Logout then login for changes in limits.conf to take effects


Another way to set limits on system resource use is via the ulimit command.





E.g: Limit number of concurrent logins of any user to 4

vi /etc/security/limits.conf.

* hard maxlogins 4

The asterisk means global/any user. 4 is the number of concurrent logins.

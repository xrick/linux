===========================Question 1=================================
What will be the effect of a computer having the following two lines in /etc/ntp.conf?
server pool.ntp.org
server tardis.example.org

The local computer’s NTP server will poll both a server in the public NTP server pool
and the server at tardis.example.org and use whichever site provides the cleanest
time data. Multiple server entries in /etc/ntp.conf tell the system to poll all of the named
servers and to use whichever one provides the best time data. 
(The pool.ntp.org subdomain and numbered computers within that subdomain give
round-robin access to a variety of public time servers.) 





===========================Question 2=================================
You’ve configured one computer (gateway.pangaea.edu) on your five-computer network
as an NTP server that obtains its time signal from ntp.example.com (an external time server). What computer(s)
should your network’s other computers use as their time source(s)?
Only gateway.pangaea.edu
 Once you’ve configured one computer on your network to use an outside time
source and run NTP, the rest of your computers should use the first computer as their
time reference. This practice reduces the load on the external time servers as well as
your own external network traffic  
(Very large networks might configure two or three internal time servers that refer to outside servers for
redundancy, but this isn’t necessary for the small network.)

NTP is suitable for use on small local networks, and in fact it’s
very helpful if you use certain protocols, such as Kerberos

What is the difference between apt and apt-get?

They are very similar command line tools available in Trusty

apt-get may be considered as lower-level and "back-end", and support other APT-based tools. apt is designed for end-users (human) and its output may be changed between versions.

Note from apt(8):

The apt command is meant to be pleasant for end users and does not need
       to be backward compatible like apt-get(8).

Take a look at this post for more information on the new tool:

A synopsis of the above link

    The big news for this version is that we included a new gapth binary that combines the most commonly used commands from apt-get and apt-cache. The commands are the same as their apt-get/apt-cache counterparts but with slightly different configuration options.

Currently the apt binary supports the following commands:

    list: which is similar to dpkg list and can be used with flags like --installed or --upgradable.
    search: works just like apt-cache search but sorted alphabetically.
    show: works like apt-cache show but hide some details that people are less likely to care about (like the hashes). The full record is still available via apt-cache show of course.
    update: just like the regular apt-get update with color output enabled.
    install,remove: adds progress output during the dpkg run.
    upgrade: the same as apt-get dist-upgrade ?with-new-pkgs.
    full-upgrade: a more meaningful name for dist-upgrade.
    edit-sources: edit sources.list using $EDITOR.

You can enable/disable the install progress [bar] via:

# echo 'Dpkg::Progress-Fancy "1";' > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99progressbar

zip-3.0-10.el7.x86_64 is a package filename. /usr/bin/zipnote is a filename. Package zip-3.0-10.el7.x86_64 contains file /usr/bin/zipnote in it


A package filename is a complete filename, but a package name is a shortened version. For instance, a package filename might be samba-4.1.9-4.fc20.x86_64.deb, whereas the matching package name is samba.). /usr/bin/zipnote is a filename of a file in package

Some dpkg operations require that you give a package filename, and others require a package
name. In particular, -i operation requires package filename


dpkg -i samba  => Nothing happens because samba is not a package filename (samba-4.1.9-4.fc20.x86_64.deb). It is just a package name (samba), so dpkg will refuse to operate on this file.

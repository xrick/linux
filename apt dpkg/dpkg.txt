dpkg-reconfigure: this tool asks the configuration questions for a specific




dpkg: debian package manager
 -r, --remove package...|-a|--pending
              Remove an installed package. This removes everything except conffiles, which may avoid having to reconfigure the package if it is reinstalled later
              (conffiles  are  configuration files that are listed in the DEBIAN/conffiles control file).  If -a or --pending is given instead of a package name,
              then all packages unpacked, but marked to be removed in file /var/lib/dpkg/status, are removed.

              Removing of a package consists of the following steps:

              1. Run prerm script

              2. Remove the installed files

              3. Run postrm script

       -P, --purge package...|-a|--pending
              Purge an installed or already removed package. This removes everything, including conffiles.  If -a or --pending is  given  instead  of  a  package
              name, then all packages unpacked or removed, but marked to be purged in file /var/lib/dpkg/status, are purged.

              Note:  some configuration files might be unknown to dpkg because they are created and handled separately through the configuration scripts. In that
              case, dpkg won't remove them by itself, but the package's postrm script (which is called by dpkg), has to take care of their removal during  purge.
              Of course, this only applies to files in system directories, not configuration files written to individual users' home directories.

              Purging of a package consists of the following steps:

              1. Remove the package, if not already removed. See --remove for detailed information about how this is done.

              2. Run postrm script.

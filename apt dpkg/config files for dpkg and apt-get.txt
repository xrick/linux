The main configuration file for dpkg is /etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg or ~/.dpkg.cfg. This file
contains dpkg options, as summarized in Table 2.5, but without the leading dashes. For
instance, to have dpkg always perform a test run rather than actually install a package,
you’d create a dpkg.cfg file that contains one line:
no-act


For APT, the main configuration file you’re likely to modify is /etc/apt/sources.list,
which was described earlier in “Using apt-get.” Beyond this file is /etc/apt/apt.conf,
which controls APT and dselect options. As with dpkg.cfg, chances are you won’t need to
modify apt.conf. If you do need to make changes, the format is more complex and is modeled after those of the Internet Software Consortium’s (ISC’s) Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) and Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) servers’ configuration files.
Options are grouped together by open and close curly braces ({}):
APT
{
Get
{
Download-Only "true";
};
};
These lines are equivalent to setting the --download-only option permanently, as
described in Table 2.7. You can, of course, set many more options. For details, consult
apt.conf’s man page. You may also want to review the sample configuration file, /usr/
share/doc/apt/examples/apt.conf. (The working /etc/apt/apt.conf file is typically
extremely simple, or it may be missing entirely and therefore not be very helpful as an
example.)
You should be aware that Debian’s package tools rely on various files in the /var/lib/
dpkg directory tree. These files maintain lists of available packages, lists of installed packages, and so on. In other words, this directory tree is effectively the Debian installed file
database. As such, you should be sure to back up this directory when you perform system
backups and be careful about modifying its contents.

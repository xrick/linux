Remember to run apt-get update before updating packages to make sure your local database reflects the latest available updates.

Apt-get update is used to update local database, it is not used to update program/package.

Use apt-get with the install option to update individual package. To update the already installed ghostscript package on my system:
sudo apt-get install ghostscript

To update all packages
sudo apt-get upgrade

Deleting Duplicate Lines with uniq
The uniq command removes duplicate lines. It’s most likely to be useful if you’ve sorted
a file and don’t want duplicate items. For instance, suppose you want to summarize
Shakespeare’s vocabulary. You might create a file with all of the Bard’s works, one word
per line. You can then sort this file using sort and pass it through uniq. Using a shorter
example file containing the text to be or not to be, that is the question (one word
per line), the result looks like this:
$ sort shakespeare.txt | uniq
be
is
not
or
question
that
the
to
Note that the words to and be, which appeared in the original file twice, appear only
once in the uniq-processed version.

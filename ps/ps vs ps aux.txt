By default, ps command without arguments only displays the processes of current controlling terminal
[root@localhost ~]# ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 6025 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
 6111 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
 
 
 ps -aux is the same with ps aux
 
  To see all the processes with controlling terminals, use the -a option. 
  The -x option displays processes without a controlling terminal
  -u: list users
  
  
  ps -ax is almost the same with ps aux. But it does not display list users.

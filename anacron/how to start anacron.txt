Of course, to do any good, the anacron utility must be called itself. This is typically
done in one of two ways:
	+ Via a Startup Script You can create a startup script to run anacron. For example, a
	simple SysV startup script (see Chapter 5) that takes no options but runs anacron should
	do the job.
	+ Via a cron Job You can create a cron job to run anacron. Typically, this call will replace
	your regular system cron job entries (in /etc/crontab), and you'll probably want to call
	anacron on a daily basis or more frequently.

	The startup script approach is best employed on systems that are shut down and started
up frequently, such as laptops or desktop systems that are regularly shut down at the end of
the day. One drawback to this approach is that it can cause sluggish performance when the
system is booted if anacron needs to run a time-consuming task.

	Calling anacron via a cron job can shift the burden to off-hours. This ensures that anacron and the jobs it handles are run fairly frequently, if not on a completely regular basis.
	Alternatively, you can call anacron more frequently than once a day. For instance, if itâ€™s
	called once every six hours, it will almost certainly be called during a typical eight-hour
	workday.
	If important jobs need to be run daily, be sure to call anacron several times
	a day. This way, any unexpected system downtime will not allow daily
	critical jobs, which must run every day, to skip an entire day.

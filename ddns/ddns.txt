DDNS Help

The Router offers a Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) feature. DDNS lets you assign a fixed host and domain name to a dynamic Internet IP address. It is useful when you are hosting your own website, FTP server, or other server behind the Router. Before using this feature, you need to sign up width DDNS service providers such as www.dyndns.org. The Dynamic DNS client service provider will give you a password or key.

Follow these instructions to set up DDNS:

Use nl command to output the line with its number 


[minhql@hoangqp ~]$ nl abc
     1  abc
     2  sds

     3  sds
     4  ss
     5  sd
[minhql@hoangqp ~]$ ls abc
abc
[minhql@hoangqp ~]$ cat abc
abc
sds

sds
ss
sd


The nl command is useful for numbering either every line in a file or stream of input, or just the lines with data on them. This is helpful when trying to troubleshoot source code or producing a list of numbered items automatically.
To number only the lines in a file that contain data, use this command:
nl file1

To number every line in a file, regardless of the line having data in it, use this:
nl â€“ba file1

Expect to see the nl command used with commands such as pr and tac chained or piped together to produce a particular output. Order matters, so be sure to notice whether the question wants to number all lines or just nonempty lines.

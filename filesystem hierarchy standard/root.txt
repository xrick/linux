/etc/fstab file contains the mappings of partitions to mount points, so /etc/ must be an oridinary directory on the root partition not on a separate partition

The /bin and /sbin directories should never be split off from the root (/) filesystem because they contain critical
executable files that must be accessible in order to do the most basic work, including
mounting filesystems

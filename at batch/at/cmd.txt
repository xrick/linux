at teatime
at> /usr/local/bin/system-maintenance
The /usr/local/bin/system-maintenance program or script is run at 4:00 p.m
The at command runs a specified program at the stated time in the future. This
time may be specified in several ways, one of which is teatime, which stands for
4:00 p.m






 At  allows  fairly complex time specifications, extending the POSIX.2 standard.  It accepts times of the form HH:MM to run a job at a specific time of day.
       (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.)  You may also specify midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) and you can  have  a  time-of-day  suffixed
       with  AM  or PM for running in the morning or the evening.  You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the form month-name day with
       an optional year, or giving a date of the form MMDD[CC]YY, MM/DD/[CC]YY, DD.MM.[CC]YY or [CC]YY-MM-DD.  The specification of a date must follow the  speci‚Äê
       fication  of  the time of day.  You can also give times like now + count time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can
       tell at to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow.

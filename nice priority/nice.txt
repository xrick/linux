The other option for altering a running program’s priority is a feature of the top command. The top command shows a refreshing screen of processes with the highest CPU usage, configurable to show only active processes or a specific number of processes
While top command is working, press r (Prompts for the PID to affect) and then provides the new priority.


-20 <= nice <= 19
-20: highest priority, 19: lowest priority
processes started by regular users usually have priority 0
Use nice command without options will display our default priority

Use nice command to start a program without nice value will set value to 10
 nice sleep 20 &


nice -5 /usr/bin/prog 
/usr/bin/prog is executed with a nice level of 5

renice -8 /usr/bin/prog 
/usr/bin/prog is executed with a nice level of -8

renice 8 /usr/bin/prog 
/usr/bin/prog is executed with a nice level of 8

top command outputs the nice values of listed programs.





$ nice -12 number-crunch data.txt
$ nice -n 12 number-crunch data.txt
$ nice --adjustment=12 number-crunch data.txt
All three of these commands run the number-crunch program at priority 12 and pass
it the data.txt file. If you omit the adjustment value, nice uses 10 as a default. The range
of possible values is –20 to 19, with negative values having the highest priority. Only root
may launch a program with increased priority (that is, give a negative priority value), but
any user may use nice to launch a program with low priority. The default priority for a
program run without nice is 0.

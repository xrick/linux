Introduction
The XmppSimulator provides JDS, XS and Tigase runtime environment which can be run on desktop using lightweight docker container technology.
It may be basis for further (UMS, BoB and other) simulation 
Setup
The xmpp simulator can be deployed on any 64 bit linux PC supporting docker it will need maximum 2.5GB of free (docker) storage
Installation steps (steps 2,3,4 can be skipped by developers just use hmc2 checkout)
Install Docker following instruction for your particular platform at https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
Install GNU make onto your PC
Create xmppsimulator tar ball (currently tip of HDGHMC-98772c, attached to this wiki page): hg status -nc hmc2/xmppclient/test/|tar cjf xmppsimulator.tar.bz2 -T -
Untar xmppsimulator_v6.tar.bz2 in a test directory: mkdir xmppsimulator; cd xmppsimulator; tar xf xmppsimulator.tar.bz2
Build the simulator docker image: make -C hmc2/xmppclient/test/ build-xmppserver
It will take some time (only first run): 20-40 minutes as it configures linux and builds Tigase from source with patches
On succesful build you will see at the end

Setup verification with STB
Here is initial setup verification procedure (any recent dev build should work with it)
make -C hmc2/xmppclient/test/xmppclient_stb/
scp hmc2/xmppclient/test/xmppclient_stb/tests/xmppserver_simulate_deploy.sh root@stb_ip:/var/viewer/
on PC run make -C hmc2/xmppclient/test/ AUTOSTART=controlbot.sh run-xmppserver-attached 
On succesful run you will see

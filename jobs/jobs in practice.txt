 type fg to bring the last process back to foreground.

If you have more than one process running in the background, do this:

$ jobs
[1]   Stopped                 vim
[2]-  Stopped                 bash
[3]+  Stopped                 vim 23







 When you run the jobs command, you see the following output:

          linux-8z04:~ # jobs
[1]-  Stopped                 top
[2]+  Stopped                 vim
[3]   Running                 strace top &

If you were to run the fg command at this time, what would happen?
=> The vim command would be brought to the foreground

 The fg command acts on the last used or last suspended, notated by the + sign . The other jobs must be interacted with by their job id.

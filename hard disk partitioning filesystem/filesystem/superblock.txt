Most filesystems have a superblock. The superblock contains information about the filesystem, such as filesystem size, inode statistics, and when the filesystem was last checked by a utility like the fsck command. It is usually stored in the first sector of the filesystem and is replicated multiple times, making it much easier to recover from errors. The first available backup superblock in the ext filesystems is usually stored at the 8,193rd block.

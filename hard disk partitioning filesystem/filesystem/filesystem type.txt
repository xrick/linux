Filesystem Types
Linux supports different filesystems, which allows the administrator to choose the one that best suits the needs of the data. The more popular filesystems supported are
 ext2—The Linux extended filesystem, which was the default for a long time.
 ext3—Essentially ext2 with journaling (logging) to help recover faster after a crash.
 ext4—Performance improvements made on top of ext3.
 iso9660—The CD-ROM filesystem.
 udf—The DVD filesystem.
 vfat—A 32-bit filesystem readable by Windows (FAT32).
 nfs—The Network Filesystem by Sun Microsystems, which is the default network file sharing protocol for all of Unix/Linux.
 smb—The Samba filesystem is Microsoft’s default file sharing protocol for network shares. It’s otherwise known as CIFS (Common Internet File System).
 xfs—The extent filesystem, adopted from Silicon Graphics (SGI) is a higher performance filesystem with many features.
 ReiserFS—At the time of its introduction ReiserFS had many novel features that have since been added to other filesystems. In particular it was first to introduce journaling and online resizing.
 btrfs—A filesystem still in development (but stable) that builds on ideas from ReiserFS and focuses on the administrative and performance needs of systems with huge amounts of storage

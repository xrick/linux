The df command reports the amount of available disk space being used by file systems (To display amount of free and used memory in the system, we can use free or top commands)

The df command is helpful for finding out which partitions are in danger of becoming
overloaded. Once youâ€™ve obtained this information, however, you may need to fine-tune the
diagnosis and track down the directories and files that are chewing up disk space. The tool
for this task is du, which has a syntax similar to that of df

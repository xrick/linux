The partition type (or partition ID) in a partition's entry in the partition table inside a Master Boot Record (MBR) is a byte value intended to specify the file system the partition contains and/or to flag special access methods used to access these partitions (f.e. special CHS mappings, LBA access, logical mapped geometries, special driver access, hidden partitions, secured or encrypted file systems, etc.).

Change a Partition’s Type
When you create a partition, fdisk assigns it a type code of
0x83, which corresponds to a Linux filesystem. If you want to create a Linux swap partition or a partition for another OS, you can type t to change a partition type code. The program then prompts you for a partition number and a type code.

List Partition Types
Several dozen partition type codes exist, so it’s easy to forget what
they are. Type l (that’s a lowercase L) at the main fdisk prompt to see a list of the most
common ones. You can also get this list by typing L when you’re prompted for the partition
type when you change a partition’s type code.

Mark a Partition Bootable
Some OSs, such as Windows, rely on their partitions having
special bootable flags in order to boot. You can set this flag by typing a, whereupon fdisk
asks for the partition number.

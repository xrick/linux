fdisk (fixed disk)

The fdisk command does not commit any changes to your disk until you tell it to. Other tools, including parted, may commit changes as you go. 

parted supports both MBR and GPT
fdisk supports MBR only
gdisk supports GPT only
Use fdisk for drives that are < 2TB and either parted or gdisk for disk > 2TB. The actual difference has to do with the partitioning formats that these tools are manipulating.

For disks < 2TB you're often using MBR (Master Boot Record). For disks > 2TB you're using GPT (GUID Partitioning Table). Here's a good article that covers the differences as well, titled: The Differences Between MBR and GPT.
What to use?

In a nutshell you can continue to use fdisk as long as the new HDDs are < 2TB. If they're larger then you can use parted or gdisk. If you need to convert from MBR to GPT you can do so (use caution with this) using gdisk.

You can read more about gdisk here on the primary website, titled: GPT fdisk Tutorial.
Example

$ gdisk -l /dev/sdb
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.4

Partition table scan:
  MBR: protective
  BSD: not present
  APM: not present
  GPT: present

Found valid GPT with protective MBR; using GPT.
Disk /dev/sdb: 5860533168 sectors, 2.7 TiB
Logical sector size: 512 bytes
Disk identifier (GUID): B40CXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
Partition table holds up to 128 entries
First usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 5860533134
Partitions will be aligned on 8-sector boundaries
Total free space is 0 sectors (0 bytes)

Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name

You can also opt to use parted exclusively. It can contend with both MBR and GPT.
Example

$ parted -l

Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt

Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name     Flags

Model: ATA ST3000DM001-1CH1 (scsi)
Disk /dev/sdc: 3001GB
Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
Partition Table: gpt

Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name     Flags
 1      17.4kB  3001GB  3001GB               primary  raid 

NOTE: Here you can see I have a 250GB MBR drive (/dev/sda, msdos) along with 2 3TB GPT drives (/dev/sdb & /dev/sdc).

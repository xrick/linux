When an application writes to disk, the kernel can cache that write in memory to make the application faster. If the computer reboots before the memory is flushed to disk, the data is lost and corruption of the disk has happened. With a journaling filesystem the write is always logged to a journal, which can be done quickly. The fsck that happens on boot can then replay that journal and get the filesystem back to a known good state with no data loss.
By using the journal there is almost no chance at corruption, so there is no need for periodic filesystem checks. Journaling writes to a disk are therefore a good thing to have in a filesystem.

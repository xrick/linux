Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder, designed to provide DNS (and optionally DHCP and TFTP) services to a small-scale network. It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global DNS.

Dnsmasq accepts DNS queries and either answers them from a small, local cache or forwards them to a real, recursive DNS server. It loads the contents of /etc/hosts, so that local host names which do not appear in the global DNS can be resolved.




Why DNSMasq instead of BIND?
One word: SIMPLICITY.
BIND is a full-fledged DNS server that can perform the roles of both an Authoritative and a Recursive nameserver, but chances are that you don't need this, as you probably already have an authoritative server for your domain - for example the one of your domain Registrar or a local Active Directory server - and one or more Recursive nameservers either internal, provided by your ISP or by a dedicated DNS service such as OpenDNS. So why using it when DNSMasq, a lightweight DNS forwarder, can let you achieve a Split DNS situation in a much easier way?

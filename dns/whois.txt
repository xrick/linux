whois You can look up information on a domain as a whole with this command. For
instance, typing whois sybex.com reveals who owns the sybex.com domain, who to
contact in case of problems, and so on. You may want to use this command with -H, which
omits the lengthy legal disclaimers that many domain registries insist on delivering along
with whois information.

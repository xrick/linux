 Type command: Display information about command type.
 
 
 You can quickly determine if a command is a built-in command by using the type command. Just enter the command type before the name of the command you wish to check:
$ type pwd
pwd is a shell builtin
$
$ type cd
cd is a shell builtin
$
$ type bash
bash is /bin/bash
$

Some of these internal commands are duplicated by external commands that do the
same thing. But those external commands aren’t always installed on all systems. You can
see if there are internal commands with installed duplicate external commands by using the
-a option on the type command:
$ type -a cd
cd is a shell builtin
$
$ type -a pwd
pwd is a shell builtin
pwd is /bin/pwd
$
You can see that on this system, there is no external cd command installed. However, it
does have an external pwd command installed.
Keep in mind that even when external commands are installed, the internal command
takes precedence. To access the external command, you must provide the complete external
command path, as in typing /usr/bin/time rather than time.


When you type a command that’s not recognized by the shell as one of its internal commands, the shell checks its path to find a program by that name to execute it. The path is a
list of directories in which commands can be found. It’s defined by the $PATH environment variable

An instance of an image is called container. You have an image, which is a set of layers as you describe. If you start this image, you have a running container of this image. You can have many running containers of the same image.
You can see all your images with docker images whereas you can see your running containers with docker ps (and you can see all containers with docker ps -a).
So a running image is a container.


[root@localhost ~]# docker images    # List images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

    "docker run" creates a new container (container is a running image) so previous changes will not be saved.
	docker run -it 0aabc93b35a6 /bin/bash
	
    "docker start" will start an existing container so previous changes will still be in the container, however you need to find the correct container-id among many with a same image-id. Need to "docker commit" to suppress versions if wanted.
	
	Copy from host to docker container
	Remember to use docker ps to check for container before using docker cp command.
	docker cp xmpp_simulator_0.8.tgz 8c462fe95ae5:/xmpp_simulator_0.8.tgz
	
    Ctrl-C will stop the container when exiting. You will want to append "&" at the end so the container can run background and gives you the prompt when hitting enter key.

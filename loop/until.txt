An until loop takes a slightly different approach. An until loopâ€™s commands execute until
its test condition returns a true. The basic form of this loop type is as follows:
until [ condition ]
do
commands
done
It looks almost identical to the while loop. It takes only a few modifications to a single
script line to make the mkuser.sh script use an until loop instead of a while loop. The
while loop test condition currently looks like this:
while [ "$Username" != "Exit" ] && [ "$Username" != "" ]
To change this to an until loop, the script line is modified to appear as follows:
until [ "$Username" = "Exit" ] || [ "$Username" = "" ]
Now the statement says to execute the commands in the do and done construct until the
variable Username equals Exit or the variable Username equals null.
As you can see, there are fairly subtle differences between a while loop and an until
loop. However, those differences can significantly impact your script if test conditions are
not written correctly.

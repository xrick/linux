A for loop is rather different in its operation compared to while and until loops. The for
loop does not test any conditions, but instead executes its commands for a certain number
of list items. The basic syntax of the for loop is as follows

for variable in list
do
commands
done

for Number in 1 2 3
do
echo $Number
done

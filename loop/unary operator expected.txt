This test condition threw an error: unary operator expected. This
is due to the Username variable now being set to nothing (null). When the shell interprets
this test condition, instead of seeing the "" != "Exit" condition, it sees the != "Exit" test
condition. It appears to the shell that the variable is missing.
There is an easy fix for this problem. Just encase the variable name in double quotation
marks as follows:
while [ "$Username" != "Exit" ]
Now the shell will see "" != "Exit" if the variable Username is set to null. This fix will
keep the test condition from generating an error.

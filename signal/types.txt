    Ctrl-C (in older Unixes, DEL) sends an INT signal ("interrupt", SIGINT); by default, this causes the process to terminate.
    Ctrl-Z sends a TSTP signal ("terminal stop", SIGTSTP); by default, this causes the process to suspend execution.
    Ctrl-\ sends a QUIT signal (SIGQUIT); by default, this causes the process to terminate and dump core.
    Ctrl-T (not supported on all UNIXes) sends an INFO signal (SIGINFO); by default, and if supported by the command, this causes the operating system to show information about the running command.

We should use SIGTERM instead of SIGKILL since SIGTERM allows the program to have time to clean up.

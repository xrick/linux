Advantage of a source package over a binary package:
+ A single source package can be used on multiple CPU architectures
+ By recompiling a source package, you can sometimes work around library incompatibilities
+ You can modify the code in a source package, thus altering the bahavior of a program
+ You may be able to recompile source code for a non-Linux Unix program on Linux

Advantage of binary package over source package:
+ Binary package can be installed more quickly than source package. Because source package must be compiled prior to installation, source packages require more time to install than binary packages.

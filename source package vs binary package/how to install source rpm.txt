If you see a source RPM file, which has a name that ends in .src.rpm, and if you have an RPM-based distribution, you can download it and generate a binary RPM. Source RPMs are converted into binary RPMs by typing rpmbuild --rebuild aprogram-1.2.3.src.rpm, where aprogram-1.2.3.src.rpm is the source RPM’s filename. The binary RPM will be stored in a location that is specified about a dozen lines above the end of the resulting output. You should not follow the normal source code compilation and installation instructions when installing a source RPM.

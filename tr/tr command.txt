You can use tr, as in tr -d '\040\011\012\015', which will remove spaces, tabs, carriage returns and newlines.

tr abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

tr without option is used to replace a character with another character


tr -d '\r' < DOS-file > UNIX-file
To fix a Linux file which can't not be run on Linux, we use above command.
The reason, Linux file does not work in Linux anymore is we download it to Windows then edit or sth like that. Or you can use dos2unix command


echo "Hello World" | tr -d aieou
Hll Wrld


-d: delete
-s: squeeze. Replace repeated characters with a single occurrence of that character

For example: tr -s ' ' < a.txt > b.txt
Above command will reduce all consecutive spaces down to a single space

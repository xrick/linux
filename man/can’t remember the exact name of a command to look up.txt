Occasionally, the problem arises where you can’t remember the exact name of a
command to look up. The man utility has an option to help you here. You can use the
-k option along with a keyword or two to search through the man pages:
$ man -k "system information"
dumpe2fs (8) - dump ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem information
[…]
uname (1) - print system information
$
The returned information (shown as a partial listing above) can give you some clues as
to your desired command name. Be aware that poor keyword choices may not produce the
results you seek.


On some older Linux distributions, you may get no results from a man
utility keyword search. This is most likely due to a missing whatis
database. The whatis database contains a short description of each man
page, and it is necessary for keyword searches. To create it or update it,
type makewhatis at the prompt. You will need to do this as superuser, and
it may take several minutes to run.

Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)?A standard created to maintain compatibility between operating systems. The standard mainly applies to UNIX and guarantees that different flavors of Linux and UNIX are compatible to one another. The POSIX standard goes relatively deep and defines how exactly programs should operate to maintain optimal compatibility. Other operating systems are partially POSIX compliant as well, including different Windows versions.

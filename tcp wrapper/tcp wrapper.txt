The two tables that affect which clients can connect to which services (provided the service uses libwrap.a or is controlled by inetd/xinetd) are /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny. tcpd (tcp wrapper) uses /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny to perform its main task of checking for access control restrictions to system services.



Scenario 1: Delete /etc/hosts.allow . Add ALL: ALL to /etc/hosts.deny to deny all connections to the services (provided the service uses libwrap.a or is controlled by inetd/xinetd)

In this case, we set up an ftp server and this server is under control of xinetd

[root@localhost ~]# ftp 192.168.100.69
Connected to 192.168.100.69 (192.168.100.69).
421 Service not available, remote server has closed connection

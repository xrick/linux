In these old days, TCP wrappers is a package which is used to provide security features for inetd. Nowadays, xinetd have built-in security features and don't need TCP wrappers to protect it anymore (If you use ldd /usr/sbin/xinetd | grep -i libwrap, libwrap.so.0 => /lib64/libwrap.so.0 (0x00007f060e192000) will still be displayed in the output. It means xinetd uses both TCP wrappers and xinetd's build-in security features).

The TCP wrappers package provides a library known as libwrap. Older TCP wrappers packages used with inetd provided a program known as tcpd. The inetd did not call a server directly; instead, inetd called tcpd, which did two things: It checked whether a client was authorized to access the server, and if the client had this authorization, tcpd called the server program.

Even though inetd has gone the way of the dinosaurs, TCP wrappers is still available for use on Linux systems. For example, the FTP server, vsftpd, uses TCP wrappers. If a network service uses TCP wrappers, then it uses the libwrap library. You can determine if a network service uses TCP wrappers or not by typing 
ldd NetworkServiceDaemon | grep libwrap at the command line. If you get output, then the network service uses TCP wrappers.
        
		[root@localhost ~]# ldd /usr/sbin/vsftpd | grep -i libwrap
        libwrap.so.0 => /lib64/libwrap.so.0 (0x00007f060e192000)
		
		
		 ls /usr/sbin | xargs ldd /usr/sbin/* 
		 You can use above command to list all external libraries of programs in /usr/sbin

Bash shell uses the built-in command set to turn on off options for the shell. You can also use shopt command to do this.

set -o option (sets the option to on)
set +o option (sets the option to off)



Important bash options:
history: On by default.
noclobber: This option is off by default, when it's on, it disallows the overwriting of an existing file by a redirect symbol (>). A syntax error occurs if this is attempted. The use of double redirects 9to append the file) is recommended.

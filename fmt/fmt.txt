fmt is designed to reformat text files, such as when a program's README documentation file uses line that are too long for your display.
By default, fmt's max column width is 75

Sometimes text files arrive with outrageously long line lengths, irregular line lengths, or
other problems. Depending on the difficulty, you may be able to cope simply by using
an appropriate text editor or viewer to read the file. If you want to clean up the file a bit,
though, you can do so with fmt

-w: max column width

minhql@ubuntu:~$ cat abc
abc 1244 45k
fdldl 4j5 ll
minhql@ubuntu:~$ fmt -w 1 abc

minhql@ubuntu:~$ fmt -w 13 abc
acb 2344 45k
fdldl 4j5 ll
minhql@ubuntu:~$ fmt -w 13 abc


fmt promises fixed line width without any word (a word contains several characters) breaking (if word is too large to fit in a line, it is still left as it is, so finally some lines may be larger in size than you need):
fmt -w 80 <text.txt

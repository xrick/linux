sed works on line 

Listing 20 shows three simple sed scripts. In the first one, we use the s (substitute) command to substitute an uppercase for a lowercase 'a' on each line. This example replaces only the first 'a' on the line => First a on line 1, line 2, line 3
In the second example, we add the 'g' (for global) flag to cause sed to change all occurrences of 'a' on the line => All a on line 1, line 2, line 3
In the third script, we introduce the d (delete) command to delete a line. In our example, we use an address of 2 to indicate that only line 2 should be deleted.
We separate commands using a semi-colon (;) and use the same global substitution that we used in the second script to replace 'a' with 'A'.

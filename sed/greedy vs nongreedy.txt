If you've used sed for a while, you've probably encountered the problem that all your (group) matches are greedy. This is easy to illustrate with an example:

Say you have this text, where you want to convert the java classes surrounded with @-signs into HTML <code/> elements:

The @HashMap@ and @ArrayList@ classes are great!

To convert this into HTML, you'd typically create groups and wrap these two inside <code> elements:

echo 'The @HashMap@ and @ArrayList@ classes are great!' | sed 's#@\(.*\)@#<code>\1</code>#g'

However, sed will always do a greedy search, matching the longest possible match, not quite yielding the result you want:

The <code>HashMap@ and @ArrayList</code> classes are great!

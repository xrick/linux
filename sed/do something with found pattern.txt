&: Sometimes you want to search for a pattern and add some characters, like parenthesis, around or near the pattern you found. It is easy to do this if you are looking for a particular string: 
sed 's/abc/(abc)/' <old >new
This won't work if you don't know exactly what you will find. How can you put the string you found in the replacement string if you don't know what it is? 
The solution requires the special character "&." It corresponds to the pattern found. 
sed 's/[a-z]*/(&)/' <old >new

sed -e '/\[/,/\]/ s/^/&\t/'      => sed -e '/start/,/end/ s/test/TEST/g' replaces all test with TEST in range from start to end
sed 's/^/&\t/'					 => Insert tab to beginning

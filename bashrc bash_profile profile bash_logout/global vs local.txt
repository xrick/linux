File global /etc/profile sets saru variable as 123 and file local ~/.bash_profile also sets saru variable as 789
Logout then login
echo $saru restulst in 789
Local file has higher priority than global file in this case. 


============================Important note=================================

It also depends on the file to decide local or global has higher priority
For example: 


Below are the contents of ~/.bashrc file
# .bashrc

# User specific aliases and functions

alias rm='rm -i'
alias cp='cp -i'
alias mv='mv -i'

shourai=localnumber
export shourai

# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
        . /etc/bashrc
fi



Below are the contents of /etc/bashrc file:
shourai=globalnumber
export shourai



Logout then login
echo $shourai restulst in globalnumber


But if we change the contents of ~/.bashrc file like this: 
# .bashrc

# User specific aliases and functions

alias rm='rm -i'
alias cp='cp -i'
alias mv='mv -i'

# Source global definitions
if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
        . /etc/bashrc
fi


shourai=localnumber
export shourai




Logout then login
echo $shourai restulst in localnumber. Troubleshooting: .bashrc sources /etc/bashrc => shourai=globalnumber then .bashrc set shourai=localnumber. So in the end, shourai=localnumber not globalnumber.

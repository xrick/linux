Running External Commands in vi
A frequent question on the exams is how to run an external command inside vi, such as seeing an ls ?l listing of the current directory so you can remember a filename:
:! ls -l

In this, the command ls ?l executes, with the command's output displaying onscreen, and you need only press Enter or enter a command to return to the vim session. If the output scrolls more than one screen, it's piped to the more command and all the normal movement keystrokes will apply.

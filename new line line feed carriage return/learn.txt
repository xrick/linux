https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline

In computing, a newline, also known as a line ending, end of line (EOL), or line break, is a special character or sequence of characters signifying the end of a line of text and the start of a new line. The actual codes representing a newline vary across operating systems, which can be a problem when exchanging text files between systems with different newline representations.

The concepts of line feed (LF) and carriage return (CR) are closely associated, and can be either considered separately or lumped together. In the physical media of typewriters and printers, two axes of motion, "down" and "across", are needed to create a new line on the page. Although the design of a machine (typewriter or printer) must consider them separately, the abstract logic of software can lump them together as one event. This is why a newline in character encoding can be defined as LF and CR combined into one (CR+LF, CRLF, LF+CR, LFCR).


LF (Line feed, '\n', 0x0A, 10 in decimal) or CR (Carriage return, '\r', 0x0D, 13 in decimal)

In Linux: \n is used to signal a newline
In Windows: \r \n is used to signal a new line

tr -d '\r' < DOS-file > UNIX-file
To fix a Linux file which can't not be run on Linux, we use above command.
Ther eason, Linux file does not work in Linux anymore is we download it to Widnwos then edit or sth like that

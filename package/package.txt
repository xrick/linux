Packages 
The most basic information that package systems maintain is information about
software packagesâ€”that is, collections of files that are installed on the computer. Packages
are usually distributed as single files that are similar to tarballs (archives created with the
tar utility and usually compressed with gzip or bzip2) or zip files. Once installed, most
packages consist of dozens or hundreds of files, and the package system tracks them all.
Packages include additional information that aids in the subsequent duties of package
management systems.

netstat stands for network statistics. This command displays incoming and outgoing network connections as well as other network information. It’s available on Windows, Mac, and Linux — each version has its own command-line options you can tweak to see different types of information.

The netstat utility can show you the open connections on your computer, which programs are making which connections, how much data is being transmitted, and other information.

netstat: print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections and multicast memberships.

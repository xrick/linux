The netstat program is considered obsolete, though you may still
find it on some Linux distributions. It is also listed in the certification
examâ€™s objectives and therefore needs to be covered here. However,
the current utility to use for network auditing and displaying network
information is the ip program. See the man pages for more information
on the ip utility.

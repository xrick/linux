Sometimes you will want vim to open a file with a search string and put the cursor on the first found instance of that string. To accomplish this, enter vi +/string filename.


Other times you'll want to edit a file and have the cursor jump to a particular line when the file is opened, such as the line 18 in the
/etc/inittab

You would enter vi +18 /etc/inittab.
Tip

The + command line option tells vim to run that particular command once the file is open.

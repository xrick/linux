 "h" to go left, "j" to go down, "k" to go up, "l" to go right.

Force Multipliers
Just about any keystroke or action can be done X number of times by prefixing it with a number.
For example, from Command mode to move down 5 lines you would type 5j. 
Moving 12 words to the right is accomplished with 12W.

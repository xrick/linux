vi modes

The vi editor has three modes of operation:

Command mode/editor mode/normal mode
    In command mode, you move around the file and perform editing operations such as searching for text, deleting text, changing text, and so on. You usually start in command mode.
Insert mode
    In insert mode, you type new text into the file at the insertion point. To return to command mode, press the Esc (Escape) key.
LastLine, also called "ex" mode
    The Ex mode is similar to the command line mode as it also allows you to enter Ex commands. Switch to "Ex" mode by entering Q.  This is a bit like typing ":"commands one after another, except:
			- You don't have to keep pressing ":".
			- The screen doesn't get updated after each command.
			- There is no normal command-line editing.
			- Mappings and abbreviations are not used.

These modes determine the way the editor behaves. Anything you type in insert mode is considered text to be inserted into the file. If you are trying to type a command and nothing happens, or the character appears under the cursor, then you probably forgot to press Esc to escape from insert mode.









Use the command vi without any additional parameters => vi starts in command mode and opens a new empty file

vi modes

The vi editor has two modes of operation:

Command mode/editor mode/normal mode
    In command mode, you move around the file and perform editing operations such as searching for text, deleting text, changing text, and so on. You usually start in command mode.
Insert mode
    In insert mode, you type new text into the file at the insertion point. To return to command mode, press the Esc (Escape) key.

These two modes determine the way the editor behaves. Anything you type in insert mode is considered text to be inserted into the file. If you are trying to type a command and nothing happens, or the character appears under the cursor, then you probably forgot to press Esc to escape from insert mode.

Hard disk devices

By default, Linux defines IDE device files as follows:

/dev/hda
Primary master IDE (often the hard disk)

/dev/hdb
Primary slave IDE

/dev/hdc
Secondary master IDE (often a CD-ROM)

/dev/hdd
Secondary slave IDE


SCSI device files (or any devices using the SCSI emulation layer) are similar, except
that there is no four-device limitation:

/dev/sda
First SCSI drive

/dev/sdb
Second SCSI drive

/dev/sdc
Third SCSI drive (and so on)

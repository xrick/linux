 lpr is used to submit a print job for printing, or an application program may call lpr itself or implement its functionality directly.
 Example: lp -d Printer_name resume.pdf  OR   lpr -P Printer_name resume.pdf . lpr resume.pdf without no option will print using the default printer.
 
 lpq utility summarizes jobs in a queue
 The job ID and job owner are both displayed by lpq
 
 lprm can remove print jobs from a queue.
 lprm -P Printer_name Job_id . Without an id, it deletes the first job.
 
 lpstat -d: determine the default printerer that print jobs go to
 
 cupsreject printer_name: makes things so that people trying to print to it get an immediate error, without needting to delete the printer.
 cupsreject command does not use option -P, -d like other commands.

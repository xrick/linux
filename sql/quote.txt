SELECT age
FROM person
WHERE name='Sean' AND age > 20
LIMIT 15



Note that the word Sean is single quoted, indicating it's a user-entered string. If it were not quoted, it would be referring to a column. 
WHERE name=Sean is an example of a filter that matches rows where the values of the name and Sean columns are identical.

Without single quote => Sean means column's header instead of a value

The database schema is the description of all the tables in the database including the makeup of the columns and any relationships between the objects.
If you need to make a change to the schema, such as to add a middle name to the author table or track a different tax in a sale table, you need to modify every row even if they don't need the tax or a middle name. In some databases, this involves downtime to lock the tables against change while the update is running.
A schemaless database does away with the notion of database enforced relationships and moves to document storage. A document is a free-form description of the entity. If an author doesn't have a middle name, it doesn't need one. If you want to track a new piece of data, you just start using it and the new documents will have it.





Below is an example of schema:
.schema
CREATE TABLE author (
id integer primary key,
first_name varchar(255),
last_name varchar(255));
CREATE TABLE book (
id integer primary key,
title varchar(255),
year integer,
author_id integer,
written integer);

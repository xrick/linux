 +n     for greater than n (>n)
 -n     for less than n (<n)
 n     for exactly n (=n)

  -mtime n
          File's data was last modified n*24 hours ago.  See the comments for 
          -atime to understand how rounding  affects  the  interpretation  of
          file  modification times.
		  
-mtime +5 will find those files last modified more than 5*24h ago and -mtime -5 will find those files last modified less than 5*24h ago. To delete files that are older than 5 days you would do:

find /mnt/sdb1/tmp/ -type f -mtime +5 -exec rm {} \;

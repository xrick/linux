mount /dev/sdb7 /mnt/shared

This command mounts the contents of /dev/sdb7 on /mnt/shared, auto-detecting the
filesystem type and using the default options. Ordinarily, only root may issue a mount command; however, if /etc/fstab specifies the user, users, or owner option, an ordinary user
may mount a filesystem using a simplified syntax in which only the device or mount point
is specified, but not both. For instance, a user may type mount /mnt/cdrom to mount a
CD-ROM if /etc/fstab specifies /mnt/cdrom as its mount point and uses the user, users,
or owner option.

mount -a
It ensures that all files systems listed with the option auto in /etc/fstab are mounted . If the filesystem is listed as noauto in /etc/fstab then mount -a will not mount this filesystem. Also, when specifying auto in the Linux /etc/fstab file's filesystem type column, Linux will mount the media automatically at boot time.

mount -r
Mount the filesystem read-only

mount -t
Use the -t fstype parameter to specify the filesystem type.
Common filesystem types are ext2 (for ext2fs), ext3 (for ext3fs), ext4 (for ext4fs), reiserfs (for ReiserFS), jfs (for JFS), xfs (for XFS), vfat (for FAT with VFAT long filenames),
msdos (for FAT using only short DOS filenames, the old 8.3 naming standard), iso9660 (for
CD filesystems), udf (for DVD and some CD filesystems), nfs (for NFS network mounts),
and cifs (for SMB/CIFS network shares). Linux supports many others. If this parameter is
omitted, Linux will attempt to auto-detect the filesystem type.

To display all currently mounted filesystems, which of the following commands could be used:
cat /proc/self/mounts
OR
mount

/etc/fstab
fstab: filesystem table

mount -a
It ensures that all files systems listed with the option auto in /etc/fstab are mounted . If the filesystem is listed as noauto in /etc/fstab then mount -a will not mount this filesystem. Also, when specifying auto in the Linux /etc/fstab file's filesystem type column, Linux will mount the media automatically at boot time.

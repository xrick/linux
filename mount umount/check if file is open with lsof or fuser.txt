The lines that appear in the output of lsof are open files. If your file is not there it means it is not open. Among the columns are PID (the process id of the program that has the file open) and the FD (the file descriptor associated with the open file). No particular value for these indicates open/closed. If it appears at all it means it's open.
lsof | grep -i usb

 fuser - identify processes using files or sockets


# fuser -m /mnt/data/
/mnt/data:          1929c
Fuser â€“ identify processes using files or sockets
The -m option denotes a mounted filesystem and returns a list of all processes with an open file on that device. In this case /mnt/data is being used by process 1929 and the c denotes that the process is using it as its current directory. The process needs to be killed, or the user needs to get out of the directory, before the device can be unmounted.
-m,--mount            show all processes using the named filesystems or block device


Case 1: they're sitting in a directory on the drive they're trying to eject and the system sees this and says, "I can't eject it, the drive's busy!"
Case 2: using lsof /dev/sdc1 to check which resource is currently holding file or connection

Another way to verify that tftpd is listening is with the lsof command:
# lsof -i:69
COMMAND  PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
xinetd  1142 root    5u  IPv4  65865      0t0  UDP *:tftp

lsof vs fuser
The usage of the two are different.
For lsof, to show opened files for certain path only, put -- in front of each path
lsof -- /home4
lsof -- /home4 -- /home2
lsof will show all opened file containing the path.
For fuser, on the other hand, show process opening the file you specified
fuser -uv <filename> 
To show processes accessing a particular path, use -m
fuser -uvm /home3
fuser is more useful in identifying process id opening a particular file.
lsof is useful to find out all file(s) opened by particular process.

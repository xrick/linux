Lock Accounts The -l parameter locks an account by prefixing the hashed password with
an exclamation mark (!). The result is that the user can no longer log into the account but
the files are still available. This lock is easily undone. The lock parameter is particularly
handy if you want to suspend user access to an account temporarily, such as, for example,
when you’ve spotted some suspicious activity involving the account.


Unlock Accounts The -u parameter unlocks an account by removing a leading exclamation mark. Be aware that the useradd command creates accounts that are locked (disabled) and have no password, unless its -p parameter is specified. Therefore, using this
passwd -u parameter on a fresh account, which is disabled, not only removes the lock
but also results in an account with no password! Normally, passwd doesn’t allow this—it
returns an error if you attempt it. Adding -f forces passwd to turn the account into one
with no password.

uname (short for unix name) is a software program in Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems that prints the name, version and other details about the current machine and the operating system running on it.

The uname -a command provides a lot more information, including the current Linux
kernel being used (2.6.32) as well as the system's hostname (server01.class.com). The
uname command is an external command. The shell also provides internal commands. It's
important to know the difference between the two command types, as explained in the
next section.

The Linux kernel is at the heart of every Linux system. Although you can’t manage the
kernel process in quite the way you can manage other processes, short of rebooting the
computer, you can learn about it. To do so, you can use the uname command, which takes
several options to display information:

Node Name The -n or --nodename option displays the system’s node name; that is, its
network hostname.

Kernel Name The -s or --kernel-name option displays the kernel name, which is Linux
on a Linux system.

Kernel Version You can find the kernel version with the -v or --kernel-version option.
Ordinarily, this holds the kernel build date and time, not an actual version number.

Kernel Release The actual kernel version number can be found via the -r or --kernelrelease option.

Machine The -m or --machine option returns information about your machine. This is
likely to be a CPU code, such as i686 or x86_64.

Processor Using the -p or --processor option may return information about your CPU,
such as the manufacturer, model, and clock speed; in practice, it returns unknown on many
systems.

Hardware Platform Hardware platform information is theoretically returned by the -i or
--hardware-platform option, but this option often returns unknown.

OS Name The -o or --operating-system option returns the OS name—normally GNU/
Linux for a Linux system.

Print All Information The -a or --all option returns all available information.
In practice, you’re most likely to use uname -a at the command line to learn some of the
basics about your kernel and system. The other options are most useful in multiplatform
scripts, which can use these options to obtain critical information quickly in order to help
them adjust their actions for the system on which they’re running.

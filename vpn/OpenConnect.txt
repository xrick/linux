OpenConnect VPN Server

OpenConnect server (ocserv) is an SSL VPN server. Its purpose is to be a secure, small, fast and configurable VPN server. It implements the OpenConnect SSL VPN protocol, and has also (currently experimental) compatibility with clients using the AnyConnect SSL VPN protocol. The OpenConnect protocol provides a dual TCP/UDP VPN channel, and uses the standard IETF security protocols to secure it. The server is implemented primarily for the GNU/Linux platform but its code is designed to be portable to other UNIX variants as well.

Ocserv's main features are security through privilege separation and sandboxing, accounting, and resilience due to a combined use of TCP and UDP. Authentication occurs in an isolated security module process, and each user is assigned an unprivileged worker process, and a networking (tun) device. That not only eases the control of the resources of each user or group of users, but also prevents data leak (e.g., heartbleed-style attacks), and privilege escalation due to any bug on the VPN handling (worker) process. A management interface allows for viewing and querying logged-in users.

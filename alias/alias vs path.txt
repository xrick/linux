For example

which ls
[minhql@localhost ~]$ which ls
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
        /bin/ls
		
		
		
In path, ls command is set to /bin/ls
But in alias, ls command is set to ls --color=auto

Alias has higher priority than path. That's why, when you type ls. It will run alias first, then run path

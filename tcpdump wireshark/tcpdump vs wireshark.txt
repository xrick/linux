wireshark - powerfull sniffer which can decode lots of protocols, lots of filters.

tshark - command line version of wireshark

dumpcap (part of wireshark) - can only capture traffic and can be used by wireshark / tshark

tcpdump - limited protocol decoding but available on most *NIX platforms

ettercap - used for injecting traffic not sniffing

All tools use libpcap (on windows winpcap) for sniffing. Wireshark / tshark / dumpcap can use tcpdump filter syntax as capture filter.

As tcpdump is available on most *NIX system I usually use tcpdump. Depending on the problem I sometimes use tcpdump to capture traffic and write it to a file and the later use wireshark to analyze it. If available I use tshark but if the problem gets more complicated I still like to write the data to a file and then use Wireshark for analysis.

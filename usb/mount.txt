inux treats external USB and IEEE-1394 disks just like SCSI devices, from a software
point of view. Typically, you can plug in the device, see a /dev/sdx device node appear,
and use it as you would a SCSI disk. This is the case for both true external hard disks and
media such as solid-state USB flash drives.

[root@localhost ~]# fdisk -l

Disk /dev/sdc: 15.5 GB, 15485370368 bytes, 30244864 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk label type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x00948f6e

[root@localhost ~]# mkdir /media/usb
[root@localhost ~]# chmod -R 777 /media/usb

[root@localhost ~]# mount /dev/sdc1 /media/usb
When typed without a filesystem type specification, mount attempts to auto-detect
the filesystem type. If the media contains any of the specified filesystems (Ext2fs, FAT, HFS, ReiserFS...) it should be
detected and the disk mounted

mount /var/usb

In case resource is busy error: 
mount -o remount,rw '/var/usb'

After that insert usb to another STB (which has ip) to get the log

In case of can not umount because of busy resource:
change directory to another directory than current usb directory, for example cd /

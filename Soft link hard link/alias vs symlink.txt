A symbolic link is *not* an alias. A symlink (symbolic link) is in the filesystem so all of the layers of the OS can use symlinks. This includes Carbon, Cocoa, Java, and BSD apps. Alias files are Finder-specific concept. Aliases are not used by the rest of the system. Only the Finder deals with aliases.

At the Finder level, aliases and symlinks are similar, but symlinks are far more versatile and used in pretty much every flavor of *nix.


An alias replaces part of your command with something else. If you wanted to save a few keystrokes on ls -l you could make an alias: alias ll=”ls –l”.
Any time you type ll by itself it will be expanded to ls -l. For example ll, ll -h, or ll *.doc are all good uses, giving you a long listing, a long listing with human readable sizes, and a long listing of all the .doc files, respectively. Typing all will not trigger the alias because aliases only operate on distinct words.

Aliases take priority over searching the path so you can make sure you always include options when running a command by redefining the command: alias rm=”rm –I”.
This redefines the rm command to always run rm -i, which prompts the user to delete instead of doing it silently.

You can defeat the alias temporarily by either fully qualifying your command (/bin/rm) or escaping it (\rm). It’s assumed that if you’re smart enough to override an alias, you’re smart enough to know the consequences of what you’re doing!

Directories

Directories use the same permissions flags as regular files, but they are interpreted differently.

    Read permission for a directory allows a user with that permission to list the contents of the directory.
    Write permission means a user with that permission can create or delete files in the directory.
    Execute permission allows the user to enter the directory and access any subdirectories.

Without execute permission on a directory, the filesystem objects inside the directory are not accessible. Without read permission on a directory, the filesystem objects inside the directory are not viewable in a directory listing, but these objects can still be accessed as long as you know the full path to the object on disk. 

Try to think that execute permission of directory is like allowing access to a house.

Directories

Directories use the same permissions flags as regular files, but they are interpreted differently.

   (4) Read permission for a directory allows a user with that permission to list the contents of the directory.
   (2) Write permission means a user with that permission can create or delete files in the directory.
   (1) Execute permission allows the user to enter the directory and access any subdirectories.

Without execute permission on a directory, the filesystem objects inside the directory are not accessible. Without read permission on a directory, the filesystem objects inside the directory are not viewable in a directory listing, but these objects can still be accessed as long as you know the full path to the object on disk. Listing 4 is an artificial example to illustrate these points.

To better understand directory permissions, think of the directory as a room. If you want to see what is in the rrom, you need a window. Think of the read permission as the window (4). If you want to get into the room, you need a door. Think of the execute permission as the door (1)

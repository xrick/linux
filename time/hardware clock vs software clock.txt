One of the basic functions of the BIOS is to manage the on-board hardware clock. This clock is initially set in the BIOS configuration by entering the date and time in the appropriate fields.
Your Linux machine actually has two clocks. The hardware clock is on the motherboard of your computer and is implemented as a separate chip. This chip is called the real-time clock because it is separate from other functions on the motherboard. It continues running even when your computer is off so that when you boot your computer you have a way of knowing the current date and time.
The other clock is the system clock and it is a part of the Linux kernel. When you are asking the kernel for the time, such as to write a timestamp to a log entry, you are getting the system clock time.
The hardware and system clocks do differ from each other and from the real time, in a process known as drift. A clock drifts because it runs slightly faster or slower, and therefore needs periodic synchronization.

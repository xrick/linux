You’re configuring a Linux system that doesn’t boot any other OS (Linux-only system). The recommended time to which the computer’s hardware clock should be set is UTC.
Linux, like Unix, maintains its time internally in Coordinated Universal Time
(UTC), so setting the computer’s hardware clock to UTC is the recommended
procedure for computers that run only Linux. 

Local time is appropriate if the computer dual-boots to an OS,
such as Windows, that requires the hardware clock to be set to local time, but this is
the second-best option for a Linux-only system.

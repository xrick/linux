Time an Operation The time command times how long subsequent commands take to
execute. For instance, typing time pwd tells you how long the system took to execute the
pwd command. The time is displayed after the full command terminates. Three times are
displayed: total execution time (aka real time), user CPU time, and system CPU time. The
final two values tell you about CPU time consumed, which is likely to be much less than the
total execution time.

:: can be used once in an IPv6 address to replace a consecutive blocks of zeroes. It can be any length of zeroes as long as it is greater than a single block. All zeroes in a single block can be represented by :0: instead of writing out all four zeroes.

In this case, it means all zeroes, or the IPv6 equivalent of the IPv4 0.0.0.0

As an example of something that is not all zeroes:

fe80:0000:0000:0000:34cb:9850:4868:9d2c

Which is properly "reduced" to:

fe80::34cb:9850:4868:9d2c

As an example, it can also be written as:

fe80:0:0:0:34cb:9850:4868:9d2c

but that is far less common than just "double coloning" it.

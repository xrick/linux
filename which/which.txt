You can use the which command to search your path and find out which command will be executed (if any) when you type a command. Listing 3 shows an example of finding the hello command before and after we update the path. 

There are some commands that the which command will not find, such as shell builtins. The type command is a builtin that will tell you how a given command string will be evaluated for execution. Listing 6 uses which and type to show that the type command is not an executable found on your path, but is a shell builtin.
Listing 6. Using type

[ian@atticf22 ~]$ which type
/usr/bin/which: no type in (/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin:
/home/ian/.local/bin:/home/ian/bin)
[ian@atticf22 ~]$ type type
type is a shell builtin

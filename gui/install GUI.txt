Welcome to the CentOS fora.

# yum grouplist | grep -Ei "gnome|kde"
GNOME Desktop Environment
GNOME Software Development
KDE (K Desktop Environment)
KDE Software Development
XFCE-4.4

So:

# yum groupinstall "GNOME Desktop Environment"

or

# yum groupinstall "KDE (K Desktop Environment)"

or

# yum groupinstall "XFCE-4.4"

Need the [extras] repo installed for XFCE. Please read about Installing Software, and Repositories, and note the warnings and advice about installing and configuring the yum priorities plugin. Non-core repos should have a higher numeric value, which is a lower priority. Lower is "better" as in golf scores.

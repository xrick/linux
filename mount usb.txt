To view which device is usb disk:
fdisk -l

mkdir /var/usb
mount /dev/sdb1 /var/usb
umount /var/usb

In case resource is busy error: 
mount -o remount,rw '/var/usb'

After that insert usb to another STB (which has ip) to get the log

In case of can not umount because of busy resource:
change directory to another directory than current usb directory, for example cd /

The Name Service Switch (NSS) configuration file, /etc/nsswitch.conf, is used by the GNU C Library to determine the sources from which to obtain name-service information in a range of categories, and in what order.  Each category of information is identified by a database name.


For example:

passwd: files
For password, the order of the query is files first

hosts: files dns
For hosts names and numbers, the order of the query is files first (in this case, file is /etc/hosts) then dns

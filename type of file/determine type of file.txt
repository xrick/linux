Identifying files

File names often have a suffix such as gif, jpeg, or html that gives a hint of what the file might contain. Linux does not require such suffixes and generally does not use them to identify a file type. Knowing what type of file you are dealing with helps you know what program to use to display or manipulate it. The file command tells you something about the type of data in one or more files. Listing 24 shows some examples of using the file command.

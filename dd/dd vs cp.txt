dd or cp?

Both dd and cp can copy files. What is the difference and when to use which? Thank you!

	
Both CAN copy files, but dd is intended for low-level copying. One major difference is that dd does not care if there are partitions or a file system---it just copies bytes (When the input file is set to a device)


	
dd is not intended to copy files (although theoretically you could copy files one by one)

dd is intended to copy bytes from one device to another (a device is a file as well) is the lowest level style you can imagine.

On top of bytes in a file you have files. Files are being handled by cp and friends.

So if you want to copy a disk or a partition byte-by-byte you would use dd. If you want to copy all files on a partition you would use cp.




	
Then I have another question...

Since dd is to copy bytes rather than files, does it mean that if a file is fragmented, using dd to copy it will also give a fragment file?

And by the way, dd allows me to give an input file by "if", so it can copy files, but not only bytes?
  	

	
dd "copies" bytes (like said before); so if you use it to copy a disk it will copy the WHOLE disk; including unallocated space...it will copy the fragmented file to the other disk as fragmented. It's like taking an "image" of your drive.

dd works on the file you specify, making it able to copy data between devices, or from a device to a file. This is commonly used for moving data if devices specifically are involved (create an iso image from a cd-rom disc for example: dd if=/dev/cdrom of=mycdrom.iso), or backup raw devices (sometimes used in RAC databases: dd if=/dev/raw/raw1 of=device_raw1)

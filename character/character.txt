Typically, 1 byte is equal to 1 character. 

But there are several exception. For example: Asian character set (e.g: Vietnamese, Japanese...), 1 character is more than 1 byte.
All Unicode variants, but also Asian character sets are multibyte character set.


For an ordinary ASCII file, the character and byte counts will be identical.
These values may diverge for files that use multibyte character encodings.

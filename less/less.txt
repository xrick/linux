You can search the file’s contents by pressing the slash (/) key followed by the search
term. For instance, typing /portable finds the first occurrence of the string portable
after the current position. Typing a slash followed by the Enter key moves to the next
occurrence of the search term. Typing n alone repeats the search forward, while typing
N alone repeats the search backward.

■ You can search backward in the file by using the question mark (?) key rather than the
slash key.

■ You can move to a specific line by typing g followed by the line number, as in g50 to
go to line 50.

■ When you’re done, type q to exit from the program.

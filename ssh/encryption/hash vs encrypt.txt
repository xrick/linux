The terms encrypted and hashed are often confused. A hashed password
is created using a one-way mathematical (cryptographic) process. The
original passwordâ€™s characters cannot be re-created from the hashed
password. If a password were encrypted, you could decrypt it and obtain
the original password characters. Passwords on Linux are hashed.
However, often in Linux documentation you will see the word encrypted
used mistakenly instead.

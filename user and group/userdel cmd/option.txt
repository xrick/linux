What would a Linux system administrator type to remove the nemo account and its home
directory?
userdel -r nemo


The userdel command deletes an account, and the -r option to userdel 
causes it to delete the user’s home directory and mail spool, thus satisfying the terms of 
the question. 
userdel -f does the same; the -f option forces account deletion and file removal under
some circumstances, but it’s meaningful only when -r is also used. This option also forces the removal of the user account, even if the user is still logged in.

Both files consist of a set of records, one line per account record. Each record begins
with a username and continues with a set of fields, delimited by colons (:). Many of these
items may be modified with usermod or passwd. A typical /etc/passwd record entry resembles the following:
sally:x:1029:503:Sally Jones:/home/sally:/bin/bash
Each record’s field has a specific meaning, as follows:
Username The first field in each /etc/passwd line is the username (sally in this example).
Password The second field has traditionally been reserved for the password. Most Linux
systems, however, use a shadow password system in which the password is stored in /etc/
shadow. The x in the example’s password field is an indication that shadow passwords are in
use. In a system that doesn’t use shadow passwords, a hashed password appears here instead.
UID Following the password is the account’s user ID (1029 in this example).
Primary GID The default login group ID is next in the /etc/passwd line for an account.
The example uses a primary GID of 503.
Comment The comment field may have different contents on different systems. In the
preceding example, it’s the user’s full name. Some systems place additional information
here, in a comma-separated list. Such information may include the user’s telephone number,
office number, title, and so on.
Home Directory The user’s home directory, /home/sally, is the next record data field.
Default Shell The default shell is the final data item in each /etc/passwd record. This is
normally /bin/bash, /bin/tcsh, or some other common command shell.
It’s possible to use something unusual here. For instance, some systems include a shutdown
account with /bin/shutdown as the default shell. If you log into this account, the computer
immediately shuts down. You can create user accounts with a default shell of /bin/false,
which prevents users from logging in as ordinary users but leaves other utilities intact.
Users can still receive mail and retrieve it via a remote mail retrieval protocol like POP or
IMAP, for instance. A variant on this scheme uses /bin/passwd as the default shell, so that
users may change their passwords remotely but can’t log in using a command shell.

The following are steps for capturing minicom output into a file (in order to review it after booting up).

    Open a minicom port to the STB
    Press "CTRL+A" and then "Z" to bring up minicom options.
    Press "L" to start logging. It will ask you to name your file.
    Name the file whatever you want (ex. logsFromMinicom) and press enter. File will be created in your home directory (the ~ directory) on your Linux computer not on STB. 
    Anything that appears in minicom is now being copied to the file. To stop logging, repeat steps 1-3 and press enter on "Close"

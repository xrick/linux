The xargs command (by default) expects the input from stdin, and executes /bin/echo command over the input. The following is what happens when you execute xargs without any argument, or when you execute it without combining with any other commands.

When you type xargs without any argument, it will prompt you to enter the input through stdin




Combine Xargs with Find Command
It is one of the most important usage of xargs command. When you need to find certain type of files and perform certain actions on them (most popular being the delete action).

The xargs command is very effective when we combine with other commands.

In the following example, we took the output of the find command, and passed it as input to the xargs command. But, instead of executing the default /bin/echo command, we are instructing xargs command to execute the rm -rm command on the input.

So, in this example, the output of the find command is all the files with *.c extension, which is given as input to the xargs command, which in-turn execute “rm -rf” command on all the *.c files.

$ ls
one.c  one.h  two.c  two.h

$ find . -name "*.c" | rm -rf           # This command won't work because rm -rf needs arguments as inputs. What find . -name "*.c" return are not arguments. 
                                          You need to use xargs to exchange/convert the output of find . -name "*.c" to arguments 

$ ls
one.c  one.h  two.c  two.h

$ find . -name "*.c" | xargs -d "\n" rm -rf

$ ls
one.h  two.h


================================================================Troubleshooting================================================================
Problems can arise if filenames contain spaces because by default xargs uses both spaces
and newlines as item delimiters. The -d "\n" option tells xargs to use only newlines as
delimiters, thus avoiding this problem in this context. (The find command separates each
found filename with a newline.)


[root@localhost /]# ls
abc  abc1  abc2  abc test  backup  bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  mummy  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
[root@localhost /]# find / -maxdepth 1 -iname 'abc*' | xargs rm -rf
[root@localhost /]# ls
abc test  backup  bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  mummy  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var

[root@localhost /]# ls
abc  abc1  abc2  abc test  backup  bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  mummy  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
[root@localhost /]# find / -maxdepth 1 -iname 'abc*' | xargs -d '\n' rm -rf
[root@localhost /]# ls
backup  bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  mummy  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var

As you can see, file (abc test) is not removed. File abc test is a file which contains space. 

For instance, consider the task of deleting several files that belong to a particular user.

====Method 1===
You can do this by piping the output of find to xargs, which then calls rm:
# find / -user Christine | xargs -d "\n" rm
The first part of this command (find / -user Christine) finds all of the files in directory tree (/) and its subdirectories that belong to user Christine. (Since you are looking through the entire directory tree, you need superuser privileges for this to work properly.)
This list is then piped to xargs, which adds each input value to its own rm command.

Problems can arise if filenames contain spaces because by default xargs uses both spaces
and newlines as item delimiters. The -d "\n" option tells xargs to use only newlines as
delimiters, thus avoiding this problem in this context. (The find command separates each
found filename with a newline.)

====Method 2===
Use print0 option of find command

====Method 3===
-0 option of xargs
-0, --null
              Input items are terminated by a null character instead of by whitespace, and the quotes and backslash are not special  (every  character  is  taken
              literally).   Disables  the end of file string, which is treated like any other argument.  Useful when input items might contain white space, quote
              marks, or backslashes.  The GNU find -print0 option produces input suitable for this mode.

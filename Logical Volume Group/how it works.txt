The base unit of storage in LVM is the physical volume (PV). A PV corresponds to a hard disk partition such as /dev/sda1 or some kind of block storage device coming from a dedicated storage system called a Storage Area Network (SAN). One or more physical volumes are combined to form a pool of storage called a volume group (VG). Under the hood the physical volume is chopped up into a series of physical extents (PE) to make allocations easier. Physical extent: A component of logical volume management. A physical volume, such as a disk, is split into blocks called physical extents. The physical extents form the basis of logical volumes.

The administrator then carves up the volume group into a series of logical volumes (LV). Each logical volume holds a filesystem that is used by the operating system.
Many interesting things can happen now that the filesystem on the logical volume is thoroughly abstracted from the exact placement on disk. If you need more disk space on a logical volume you can take it from anywhere in the volume group. If the volume group is low on space simply add another physical volume to the volume group and the new physical extents are available to any logical volume.

Filesystems can be grown and shrunk by adjusting the size of their underlying logical volume as long as the filesystem supports it. The LVM system takes care of allocating the physical extents to the logical volume so you don't have to worry about shuffling around partitions on disk anymore.
Snapshotting is now possible in an LVM enhanced system. A snapshot takes a point in time copy of a logical volume and makes it available as another disk while still allowing writes to happen to the original filesystem. This allows you to back up the snapshot image without needing to take the files or database offline; you can continue to work and change the files for later backup.

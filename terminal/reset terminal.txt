Watch out for questions about how to view binary files. The od command is just about the only possibility for such viewing. If you do have a problem with a garbled console after accidentally viewing a binary file, use the reset command. It reinitializes the terminal and makes it readable again. Another fun option is the strings command, which shows you the text contained in a binary file, instead of garbling up the screen.

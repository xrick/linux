Three DHCP clients are in common use on Linux: pump, dhclient, and dhcpcd (not to
be confused with the DHCP server, dhcpd). Some Linux distributions ship with just one
of these, but others ship with two or even all three

rpm -qa | grep -i -e pump -e dhclient -e dhcpcd


If you need to run a DHCP client manually, you can usually do so by typing its
name (as root), optionally followed by a network identifier, as in dhclient eth0, to have
the DHCP client attempt to configure eth0 with the help of any DHCP server it finds on
that network.

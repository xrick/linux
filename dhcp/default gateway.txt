You can use route cmd to add default gateway manually. This method is only temporary (this default gateway will be removed when rebooting), you need to set default gateway using /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0 to make it permanently.


route add default gw 192.168.29.1



 To add a default gateway of 192.168.0.1, the command would be:
 route add default gw 192.168.0.1. Specifying the IP address of the host
system (as in route add default gw 192.168.0.10 192.168.0.1) is not necessary and in fact will confuse the route
command

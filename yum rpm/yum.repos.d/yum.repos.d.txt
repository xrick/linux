Yum is configured via the /etc/yum.conf file, with additional configuration files in the
/etc/yum.repos.d/ directory. The yum.conf file holds basic options, such as the directory to which Yum downloads RPMs and where Yum logs its activities. 
Chances are that you won't need to modify this file. The /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory, on the other hand,
potentially holds several files, each of which describes a Yum repository?that is, a site
that holds RPMs that may be installed via Yum. You probably shouldn't directly edit these
files; instead, if you want to add a repository, you should manually download the RPM that
includes the repository configuration and install it using rpm. The next time you use Yum,
it will access your new repository along with the old ones. Several Yum repositories exist,
mostly for Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora, such as the following:

Livna This repository (http://rpm.livna.org/) hosts multimedia tools, such as additional codecs and video drivers.

KDE Red Hat Red Hat, CentOS, and Fedora favor the GNU Network Object Model

Environment (GNOME) desktop environment, although they ship with the K Desktop

Environment (KDE) too. The repository at http://kde-redhat.sourceforge.net provides improved KDE RPMs for those who favor KDE.

Fresh RPMs This repository (http://freshrpms.net) provides additional RPMs, mostly
focusing on multimedia applications and drivers.

Many additional repositories exist. Try a Web search on terms such as yum repository, or check the web page of any site that hosts unusual software that you want to run to see whether it provides a Yum repository. If so, it should provide an RPM or other instructionson adding its site to your Yum repository list.

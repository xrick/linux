The RPMFind website, http://rpmfind.net, is an extremely useful
resource when you want to find an RPM of a specific program. Another
site with similar characteristics is Fresh RPMs, http://freshrpms.net.
These sites include links to RPMs built by programs’ authors, specific
distributions’ RPMs, and those built by third parties. Adding such sites
as Yum repositories to your repository library can make it even easier to
install new programs.

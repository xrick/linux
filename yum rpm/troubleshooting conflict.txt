You have rpmforge and rpmforge-extas enabled. I no longer feel comfortable recommending that anyone use rpmforge as almost no packages there have been updated for 2 or 3 years so many of them have unfixed security vulnerabilities. In addition, rpmforge-extras contains packages that overwrite ones from CentOS base and updates repos.

I think you should try running yum --disablerepo=rpmforge\* update \*lsb\* and see if the lsb packages will update by themselves.
OR vi /etc/yum.repos.d/rpmforge.repo then change enabled to 0. Finally, run yum update \*lsb\

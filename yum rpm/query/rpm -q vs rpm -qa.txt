rpm -q is used with a complete name
rpm -q samba => Works
rpm -q sam => Does not work
rpm -qa samba => Works
rpm -q sam => Does not work
rpm -qa | grep sam => Works

That's why, it is the best if you use rpm -qa to list all installed package. Then use grep command to search for a package instead of using a complete name

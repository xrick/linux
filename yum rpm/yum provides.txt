In general, when you get an error like this (/lib/ld-linux.so.2: bad ELF interpreter: No such file or directory), just do

yum provides ld-linux.so.2

then you'll see something like:

glibc-2.20-5.fc21.i686 : The GNU libc libraries
Repo        : fedora
Matched from:
Provides    : ld-linux.so.2

and then you just run the following like BRPocock wrote (in case you were wondering what the logic was...):

yum install glibc.i686









 provides or whatprovides

              stall operates on groups, files, provides and filelists just like the "install" command.
              work  for  "installonly"  packages,  like Kernels. downgrade operates on groups, files, provides, filelists and rpm files just like the "install"
              cates", "obsoletes" or "provides", to limit the checking that is performed (the default is "all" which does all).

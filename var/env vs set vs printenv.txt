The output variation of the commands env, set, and printenv are
rather subtle. The set command displays both environment variables
and user-defined variables in an alphabetically sorted list. The env and
printenv commands do not sort their output and do not show userdefined variables. In addition, the env command has additional functionality that the printenv command does not have.
